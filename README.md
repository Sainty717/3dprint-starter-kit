## Checklist for Printing

1. **Level the Bed**
   - If you change the plastic (filament), adjust the temperature of the bed accordingly for proper leveling.

2. **Clean the Bed**
   - Ensure the bed is free from any debris or previous print residue.

3. **Apply Glue to the Bed**
   - Apply a thin layer of glue to help the print adhere better to the bed.

4. **Move to SD Card**
   - Transfer the sliced file from your computer to the SD card that your 3D printer uses.

5. **Print from Media**
   - Insert the SD card into the 3D printer and start printing.

By following this guide, youâ€™ll be well on your way to creating amazing 3D prints. Happy printing!
